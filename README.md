## About

I have been working on AngularJS application. We have complex pages that require us to use multiple tables in a single query. After retrieving required information, in order to use it in controller, we had to manipulate resulting array, and convert it into nested javascript object. Since there was no library to make this work, I wrote my own function and thought I could save someone's hours by sharing the source code. So, feel free to use it in anyway you want :)
